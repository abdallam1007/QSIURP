   ************* Beginning Zone Sizing Calculations
   ** Warning ** checkSubSurfAzTiltNorm: Outward facing angle of subsurface differs more than 30.0 degrees from base surface.
   **   ~~~   ** Subsurface="WF-1" Tilt = 90.0  Azimuth = 120.0
   **   ~~~   ** Base surface="FRONT-1" Tilt = 90.0  Azimuth = 30.0
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 5 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** Each Unused construction is shown.
   ************* Construction=SB-U
   ************* Construction=FLOOR-1
   ************* Construction=DBL CLR 3MM/13MM ARG
   ************* Construction=DBL CLR 6MM/6MM AIR
   ************* Construction=DBL LOE (E2=.1) CLR 6MM/6MM AIR
   ************* Beginning System Sizing Calculations
   ************* SizeHVACSingleDuct: Potential issue with equipment sizing for AirTerminal:SingleDuct:VAV:Reheat = "SPACE1-1 VAV REHEAT".
   **   ~~~   ** User-Specified Minimum Cooling Air Flow Fraction of 0.10000 [m3/s]
   **   ~~~   ** differs from Design Size Minimum Cooling Air Flow Fraction of 0.20000 [m3/s]
   **   ~~~   ** This may, or may not, indicate mismatched component sizes.
   **   ~~~   ** Verify that the value entered is intended and is consistent with other components.

   ************* ===== Recurring Surface Error Summary =====
   ************* The following surface error messages occurred.
   *************
   ************* Base Surface does not surround subsurface errors occuring...
   ************* Check that the GlobalGeometryRules object is expressing the proper starting corner and direction [CounterClockwise/Clockwise]
   *************
   ** Warning ** Base surface does not surround subsurface (CHKSBS), Overlap Status=Partial-Overlap
   **   ~~~   **   The base surround errors occurred 1 times.
   **   ~~~   ** Surface "FRONT-1" overlaps SubSurface "DF-1"
   *************
   **   ~~~   **   The base surround errors occurred 1 times (total).

   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
